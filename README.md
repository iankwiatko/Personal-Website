# Personal Website
## Overview
A modern personal website built with React.js, Node.js, and styled using Tailwind CSS, hosted on AWS for speed and reliability. It highlights my work experience and projects, contains a blog for updates on projects or my dev journey and, a skills heatmap dynamically generated from GitHub data that visually represents my expertise and tech stack. With a clean, responsive design and seamless navigation, this site offers an engaging way for visitors to learn about my skills, projects, and how to connect with me.
